Special instructions:
RR known not to work. See mail I sent, please!

Unfortunately I had to be in the hospital and
furthermore rest for a couple of days after an internal failure and chronic asthma :/

For what types of workloads does SRJN deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?
Example: Six tasks arrive after eachother, the first one is much longer than the others.


For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRJN deliver the same response times as RR?
Small quantum lengths, short workloads

What happens to response time with SRJN as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?
Grows!

Input:
40 17
800 234
122 690

Output:
Job   2 -- Response: 1.00  Turnaround 48.00  Wait 8.00
Job   3 -- Response: 1.00  Turnaround 8.00  Wait 0.00
Job   4 -- Response: 17.00  Turnaround 123.00  Wait 27.00



What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?
Response time is shorter as the quantum lengths increase.


Sorry, I did not have time to provide longer answers.
