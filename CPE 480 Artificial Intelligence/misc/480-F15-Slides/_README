This directory contains the slides used in the CPE/CSC 480 class, plus some other material for students in the class.
Initially, the slides from the previous instance of the course are in a directory OLD-Slides, from where I'll move them to this directory as needed.
Feel free to download the older ones for a preview, but keep in mind that there may be changes for the most recent versions. Usually these changes are minor, but occasionally I'll make more significant revisions.
There are usually three versions for each slide deck: The main version is in Apple's Keynote format (.key), from which I create MS PowerPoint (.ppt or .pptx) and PDF versions.
